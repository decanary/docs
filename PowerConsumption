Power Consumption:

Idle, accelerometer on 12.5Hz - 0.3mA
Idle, accelerometer on 1.25Hz (Bangle.setPollInterval(800)) - 0.15mA (default if not moved for ~120s)
Idle, clock (s7clk) updating once a second - 0.5mA
BLE Connected in high bandwidth mode - 0.75mA
Compass on, 12.5Hz - 5.5mA (+5mA)
Compass on, 1.25Hz (Bangle.setPollInterval(800)) - 0.9mA (+0.6mA)
Heart rate monitor on - 1.0mA (+0.7mA) (KickStarter version = ~1.5mA)
100% CPU usage running JavaScript - 4mA (+3mA)
GPS on - 26mA (+25mA)
GPS on (set to GPS only) - 20mA (+19mA)
LCD touchscreen enabled (unlocked) - 2.8mA (+2.5mA)
LCD backlight on - 17mA (+16mA)
Turned off (Bangle.off - no RTC) - 0.02mA
Turned off (Bangle.softOff) - 0.03mA

Right now you can expect around 1 month of battery life with a clock that updates once a minute, using the latest firmware.

A clock that updates once a second all the time (like s7clk) will reduce the battery life to 2 weeks, and more complicated clocks can increase the power draw further.
